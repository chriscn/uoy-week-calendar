# uoy-week-calendar

This NodeJS server provides an iCalendar containing the week numbers for the University of York terms. It is partly inspired by [kothar/uoy-weekcalendar](https://github.com/kothar/uoy-week-calendar), however he has made it [clear](https://github.com/kothar/uoy-week-calendar/blob/3648bc85d0478d19cb6d6bef9ca5ba7dd907f9ff/index.php#L28) that he won't be updating the calendar; the calendar itself is currently offline.

## Features

Status: **Alpha**

- [ ] Provides a iCalendar subscription of the current terms dates
- [ ] Customizing the calendar if you are a undergraduate, postgraduate or staff member.
- [ ] Provides an API to get the calendar events yourself

I am to achieve the first two before I declare this production ready.

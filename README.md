# uoy-week-calendar

This NodeJS server provides an iCalendar containing the week numbers for the University of York terms.   

It is partly inspired by [kothar/uoy-weekcalendar](https://github.com/kothar/uoy-week-calendar), however he has made it [clear](https://github.com/kothar/uoy-week-calendar/blob/3648bc85d0478d19cb6d6bef9ca5ba7dd907f9ff/index.php#L28) that he won't be updating the calendar; the calendar itself is currently offline.

All commit messages should follow the [Convential Commit](https://cheatography.com/albelop/cheat-sheets/conventional-commits/) specification.
